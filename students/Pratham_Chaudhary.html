                I'm Pratham Chaudhary, and I'm 19 years old. I come from a business family. I am a straightforward,
                sweet, self-assured, and cunning fellow. Delhi is where I was born and raised. My education took place
                in the same city as well. I am pursuing a 5-year Integrated Management Program at the Indian Institute
                of Management in Rohtak and currently I am a third-year student.

                        Traveling is one of the few activities in our lives that acts as a kind of reset button. You go
                        away for a few days or weeks and return refreshed and ready to face life's difficulties.
                        Travelling has always been part of our family tradition. I love traveling, and I try to take a
                        trip every season.

                        Also, apart from travelling I like competing on a sports team. I’ve played sports since high
                        school, so I joined the football team of my college to stay in shape and meet new people in the
                        area.

                My short-term goal is to find a job after graduation that complements my skills and allows me to broaden
                my horizons with exciting learning opportunities in the coming months. In the long run, I want to learn
                everything I can about marketing, and I aim to make at least 20 LPA in an upper management position
                within the next five years.

                Everyone has a particular hobby that they enjoy doing for enjoyment or leisure. They can be either
                physical activities like jogging, football, swimming or mental activities like reading etc. For me,
                watching movies and playing computer games is my hobby since I enjoy playing video games and watching
                movies and it helps to take the stress away.
